> [!IMPORTANT] Configuration Profile vs Tenant-wide Policy
> When the device is enrolled in Intune, a tenant-wide policy is applied to the device. **This policy is applied at enrollment time only, and any changes to its configuration won't apply to devices already enrolled in Intune**. For this reason, this policy is usually disabled, and Windows Hello for Business can be enabled using a policy targeted to a security group.
