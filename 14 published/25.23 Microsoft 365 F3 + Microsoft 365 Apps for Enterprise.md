You'd think adding M365 Apps for enterprise license will work with Microsoft 365 F3 (which doesn't include desktop apps), but it doesn't. 

M365 F3 SKU is using **Exchange Online Kiosk (2GB)**, and whilst M365 Apps for Enterprise will activate Word, Excel, and the Outlook App itself, it will not let the mailbox sync.

If you try to connect it via Outlook app, the logs will show like below:

```logs
{"Session ID":"7F0D8F27-B2FB-48FC-BB2E-AC4E5E5572EF","Client ID":"CD22B0A7-758A-480C-8FF7-9CACE7E6FB38","Profile name":"SupportProfile_1","Accounts in profile":[],"AutoDetect settings":{"Services":[{"Service name":"Office365","Protocol name":"EAS","Server name":"outlook.office365.com"}],"Protocols":[{"Protocol name":"EAS","Autodiscover":"","Domain":"","Server name":"outlook.office365.com","Port":0,"Encryption":"Unknown","Protocol insecure reason":"Unknown","User name":"","Validated":false},{"Protocol name":"ExchangeAutodiscover","Autodiscover":"","Domain":"","Server name":"outlook.office365.com","Port":0,"Encryption":"Unknown","Protocol insecure reason":"Unknown","User name":"","Validated":false}]},"Account config settings":{"Account type":"Exchange","Email address":"tswift@executivecats.com","Provider ID":"","User principal name":"tswift@executivecats.com","Exchange server resolved":false,"Number of protocols found":0,"Exchange protocol found":false,"Server settings":{}}}
```

And any attempt to turn on MAPI (yes even though its legacy protocol) will not work:

You need to get something with Exchange Online Plan instead.
