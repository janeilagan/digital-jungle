Go outside, take a breath

Spin around, and let out a laugh

Because it’s never going to feel this way again



Hum on the subway, text them first 

Smile at strangers, it could be worse

And it’s never going to feel this way again



Drink it in and hold me tighter 

Because this world keeps getting wider 

And it’s never going to feel this way again



I don’t want to sit back and let life fly away

I want to touch it, breathe it, carve it in my bones

I want to fall hard, crash and burn

Under city skylines and stars and birds

Because it’s never going to feel this way again



Buy that new book you’ve been adoring 

Take that dare you’ve been ignoring

Because it’s never going to feel this way again



Take a train, call a cab

Lean out the window and grab his hand

Because it’s never going to feel this way again



I don’t want to be restrained to a vanilla life

I want to taste it, hold it, savor every drop

I want to jump off cliffs and freeze and fly

Fill up every second until I die

Because it’s never going to feel this way again



Let your heart be young

Let moments sing, and always be listening

Because they’re never going to sound like that again



Lean in, kiss quick, then slip away

Seep in, ride your bike far away

Go on adventures, leap and run

Don’t be afraid to love someone

Because it’ll never feel this way again
