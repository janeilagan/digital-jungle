When you set a company-wide expiration date for your anonymous links, this enforces a mandatory expiration date for your anonymous links on the tenant level and determines the lifespan of anonymously shared links.  
When your user tries to share an anonymous link, the link expiry days will be set to whatever you configured at the tenant level. The user can change the expiration date by providing a day lesser than the value configured at the tenant level. However, If the user tries to change the link expiration date beyond the limit set, They’ll receive an error “Your organization’s policy doesn’t allow links to stay active for more than 30 days.” This expiry day setting applies to both SharePoint Online and OneDrive.
