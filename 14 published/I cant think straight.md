> Every night I empty my heart, but by morning it’s full again
> 
> Slow droplets of you seep in through the night’s soft caress
> 
> At dawn I overflow with thoughts of us
> 
> And aching pleasure that gives me no respite
> 
> Love cannot be contained
> 
> The neat packaging of desire splits asunder
> 
> Spilling crimson through my days
> 
> Long languishing days that are now bruised tender with yearning
> 
> Spent searching for a fingerprint, a scent, a breath you left behind.
