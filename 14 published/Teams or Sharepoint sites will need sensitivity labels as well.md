Resource: [Use sensitivity labels with Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Groups, and SharePoint sites - Microsoft Purview (compliance) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-teams-groups-sites?view=o365-worldwide)

> When only this scope is selected for the label, the label won't be displayed in Office apps that support sensitivity labels and can't be applied to files and emails. Having this separation of labels can be helpful for both users and administrators, but can also add to the complexity of your label deployment.

> For example, you need to carefully review your [label ordering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels?view=o365-worldwide#label-priority-order-matters) because SharePoint detects when a labeled document is uploaded to a labeled site. In this scenario, an audit event and email are automatically generated when the document has a higher priority sensitivity label than the site's label. For more information, see the [Auditing sensitivity label activities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/sensitivity-labels-teams-groups-sites?view=o365-worldwide#auditing-sensitivity-label-activities) section on this page.
