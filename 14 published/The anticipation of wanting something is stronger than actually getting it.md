The dopamine anticipation gives is higher than actually getting what you anticipated.

This may lead to [[impulsive decisions]] because of the ‘craving’ and ‘wanting’.

Or, maybe not impulsive buying, but wanting something so badly you justify the need to get it, spend months researching it, and your mind gravitating around the idea that what you want is something you actually *need*. We desire things we do not have. 

But then sometimes, the moment we get it, it loses it’s value right away and you’re on to your next big thing. 

We like the thrill of the chase and the moment we get it, it’s importance declines. 

Make conscious decisions and always ask yourself whether what you’re chasing is something you honestly, positively, surely need without any already available alternative.
