# Why

From my first coaching session with my life coach, I learned that in order for me to "fix" the things that are currently hindering my personal goals, I need to start finding new evidences for experiences I was used to. This is in line with the thought that what gets rewarded gets repeated, and if I don't start teaching my loved ones how to love me, they will not do so. 

As an example, we learned that whenever I feel guilty, I tend to overcompensate. Now, even unconsciously, my loved ones had gotten used to this, and since what gets rewarded gets repeated, I was often put in situations wherein they would make me feel guilty, so I would overcompensate. 

If I want to break this cycle (and some other more), I need to start finding new evidences that there are other ways to resolve the feeling of guilt, other than overcompensating. Maybe, I even need to reflect and figure out why I feel guilty, and if the reason is actually valid. Then decide from there what is actually the best approach for the situation, instead of automatically overcompensating.

In order to do this (and some other more), I started a personal project of getting to know myself. 



# How

Using Obsidian, I updated my daily notes to include certain tags for tracking, and used  [heatmap-calendar-obsidian](https://github.com/Richardsl/heatmap-calendar-obsidian) to create a heatmap.

My daily notes also consisted of some other sections like dream-tracking and reflections to link my emotions and responses to what I feel. 

This is linked to each other so I can easily review and determine the patterns.

I am excited to learn more about myself in this journey. 

Here's to hoping for good things.
