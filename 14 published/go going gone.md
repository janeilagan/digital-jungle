# foreword

anxiety. infatuation. depression. sex. disappointment. love. dejection. promise.

i don't want to be categorized. paradoxical.

it's a shame to attempt to understand how this works.

---

# 1

it's not easy, nothing is.

---

# 2

somebody once thought i don't have secrets. they didn't know i was hiding it in plain sight.

---

# 3

people would always have different versions of you. which one is your version of you?

---

# 4

then i promised i would write my feelings on paper and not on my own skin.

---

# 5

i lie because people i like wouldn't be able to handle my truth.

---

# 6

wouldn't it be nice to have someone you can be spontaneous with?  

let's go ride a bus to nowhere at two am.

---

# 7

parents might as well be gods. they have the power to create and the power to destroy.

---

# 8

the funny thing is if you asked me what love is, i wouldn't know how to answer.

---

# 9

we are all just looking for someone who'll say "me too!".

---

# 10

why does difference scares me? why am i afraid of being with someone who doesn't like the same things i do?

---

# 11

when i was thirteen, i thought i'd be mature by eighteen.

---

# 12

if you told someone you write poetry and didn't ask to read your words, run.

---

# 13

i used to tear leaves of plants from sidewalks but then i felt bad for ruining life. now i just watch them as they sing to the sun.

---

# 14

aren't you afraid?  

what if you're meant to be alone?  

aren't you afraid?  

what if you're not?

---

# 15

i was asked to just be myself, but then i got judged by doing the exact thing.

---

# 16

you stopped looking both ways when crossing the street. yes, you stopped cutting, but you never started living.

---

# 17

you wonder; what if you're prettier? what if you're smarter? what if you're like most girls? would you be enough for you?

---

# 18

you tell them about you; you're narcissist.  

you change your mind too fast; you're conflicted.  

when will you realize you'll never get it right?

---

# 19

anyone-  

just please take me away

---

# 20

one day im gonna be brave enough to just let go

---

# 21

your vision's blurry from all the tears and the rain and there's something else that tasted like metal;  

yet it's blood.

---

# 22

someone  

save me please

---

# 23

are your secrets bad?  

aren't all secrets?

---

# 24

and sometimes i was contrite about my own self  

i should have loved me more than this

---

# 25

you smell like arousal and i indulge in the sweetness of your redolence  

tasting, tasting, tasting.

---

# 26

there's a valley between your thighs that unbosoms heaven  

drawing devils in, drawing devils to, drawing devils deep

---

# 27

sticky on my lips, your promise remained  

i reached for it with my tongue  

i got burnt  

i never realized it was hot

---

# 28

licking, do you want a taste?  

forbidden, do you still resist?  

moans and echoes, echoes, echoes.

---

# 29

breaking, screeching, pounding  

hungry stomachs, tired bodies, confused minds  

go. going. gone.

---

# 30

you saved me from the rapist to fuck me over and over again

---

# 31

pushing two fingers deep, you swore you're in love  

you came down from ecstasy  

it was a mistake

---

# 32

i found an oasis in the rift between your legs  

but it made me thirstier  

so i drowned in the torrent  

when you drenched me deeper

---

# 33

you ask me how am i doing  

and i answer im fine  

because that's what you want to hear  

you ask me how am i doing  

and i answer im okay  

because that's what normal people say  

but if i answered you honestly  

we won't be finished  

so i'd stick to im good  

because you don't need to know the truth

---

# 34

ive always been afraid of being alone  

because my mind is not a safe place  

ive always been afraid of my own thoughts  

because they're leading me to darkness

---

# 35

she was too good for me and im afraid i'd suck all the goodness in her  

i was used to toxic, she was too healthy  

i was used to getting pushed down, she was pushing me up  

and im afraid, because i know me  

and all i do is break nice things

---

# 36

  
some people thought i run to be fit  

i run because it shuts my mind  

it shuts my thoughts  

it shuts me  

i run

---

# 37

  
you: there are other people who have it worse than you do  

me: and that's supposed to make me feel better?

---

# 38

always the flight risk  

if something goes wrong, run  

if something goes right, run  

always running, running, running

---

# 39

there's a reason why i haven't been in a long term relationship  

i tend to break things when there's a slight crack  

i tend to throw things before they even get messy  

i tend to leave before im left

---

# 40

im starting to feel something for someone  

and i told myself i wont write about it  

i told myself i'll never write about her  

so this would be the last thing i'll write about you  

hey, i really really want to keep you.

---

# 41

im so insecure that i literally hate every fiber of my being

---

# 42

im feeding my insecurities the same way im feeding my demons  

they became so acquainted I don't even know which is which

---

# 43

tiptoe. baby steps. slow motion.  

walking on shards of broken glasses.  

any minute now. any second. any moment.  

explosions. boom. gone.

---

# 44

and this is where it ends  

im gonna start writing about you  

im gonna start missing you  

then im letting you go  

go

---

# 45

and i came out from the room of toxicity only to find myself entering the exact same door

---

# 46

under appreciation because she's used to getting everything she wants

---

# 47

and you let yourself indulge in few minutes of heaven not knowing it's actually the highway to hell

---

# 48

  
you looked so fucking harmless  

but then again so did cigarettes

---

# 49

  
how can someone who inhales air breathe out poetry  

how can someone so soft cause you a terrible tragedy  

how can someone you knew was trouble became your serenity  

how can someone like you tame the living beast inside of me?

---

# 50

there's a distinct smell that you loved about girls like her  

they smelled like destruction and yet you're addicted  

you didn't know they're burning you up from the inside  

yet you happily inhaled all the ashes that came with them

---

# 51

and i wonder if there is something beneath your cover that you're hiding  

or if you're who you are now, nothing deep, just a plain surface

---

# 52


and all my friends kept saying you don't deserve me  

but then why do i feel like im not worthy enough for you?

---

# 53

you realized you're so fucked up when you found out she can burn you with her touches

---

# 54

heart shaped hickey on your neck  

lips swollen, wounded, scarred  

bodies blended as one  

yes, yes, yes

---

# 55

she tasted like something you never tasted before  

and you're addicted  

craving for more, craving for more

---

# 56

you're trying to find her scent in everything  

you tried every perfume in the mall  

you tried all the clothes in your drawer  

you tried the flower shops, the morning dew, the coffee shop you always go to  

but nothing smelled her  

for she smells like home

---


# 57

we are each other's glitches

---

# 58

she would kiss the scars like she's amazed by them  

she would touch my broken pieces like they're diamond shards  

she's not trying to fix me  

she never would

---

# 59

can i go now?

---

# 60

don't leave me alone with my thoughts  

they're demons ive fed over time that has grown to consume me  

trying to get back at me  

trying to devour me, too

---

# 61

and baby, don't cry  

im not on drugs yet im high

---

# 62

the scary thing about my panic attacks  

is that i already stopped crying when they come  

i just stare into space  

counting sheep that doesn't exist  

one sheep, two sheep, three sheep

---

# 63

  
you fell in love with a girl who says life starts at thirty  

it's funny because you planned to end yours at that

---

# 64

  
and you found refuge in her body  

safety in her kiss, safety in her touch  

and you're not even religious  

yet when your body touches hers  

you swear to God

---

# 65

have you ever wondered, babe  

why i moan when you bruise my lips  

why my breath hitches when you dig your nails  

why my eyes roll back when you grip my neck

---

# 66

  
there were monsters everywhere  

under my bed when i was young  

inside my closet while growing up  

there were monsters lurking in the dark  

on my left, running behind my back  

there were monsters, i was afraid  

so i cried myself to sleep  

but now that i turned on the lights  

they were all angels in disguise  

they were me, they're all mine

---

# 67

with a font size of twenty eight  

printed on the page that is your skin  

a period, no, an exclamation mark  

warning others  

of where my mouth has been  

of what my tongue had tasted  

of where my fingers had been deep

---

# 68

  
my hands on your thighs  

your hands on my face  

we're doing the same thing  

keeping each other still

my mouth on your hardened bud  

your fingers caught in my hair  

we're doing the same thing  

keeping our breathing even

i gather your sweet taste with my lips  

you close your eyes as i did  

we're doing the same thing  

both our hearts convulsing

---

# 69

knuckle deep into the tightest part of you  

yet i want to push deeper  

it's selfish, isnt it?  

when i want to take that from you  

i promised not to break your heart  

but i wanna tear that skin tissue apart

---

# 70

and sometimes id draw  

venn diagrams  

of why we aren't meant to be


---

# 71

waterfall of a hair  

falls perfectly in her shoulders;  

in her back, heavenly, celestial  

those stars and constellations;  

Lichtenberg (oh God, in her bare bottom, I'd lick)  

her eyes, Rotomairewhenua, (in a heartbeat, i'd pick)  

tracing her cheeks, i found little pinnipalmate  

and everyday my soul wonders if it found its mate;  

in the body of my lover i found nature and solace  

meriggiare in her arms, --for me, no one's more flawless

---

# 72

you think you're okay

but then days would come when both your hands and feet are cold from being anxious

and your eyes are watery because you're about to cry

and then you'd pretend everything is okay because you can't let anyone see how you're crumbling inside
