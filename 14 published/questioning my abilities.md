2023-05-27: I often find myself questioning my own abilities 3/4 of the time. Sometimes, it's because I genuinely think I do not know what's going on, but I also find myself just not speaking up and feeling dumb, only ending up actually knowing things.

Sometimes I would sit in silence in large meetings and listen as people try to find solutions for things, usually because I feel like they would know the answer better than I would have. 

I would then think of what my answers would be if it were me, only to end up that what I was thinking the very first thing, was actually the correct answer. 

It's like the opposite of [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]] which I just found out could be [[imposter syndrome]].
