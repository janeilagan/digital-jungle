## Before creating gMSA Accounts

Check if there's KDSRootKey by running:

```powershell
Get-KDSRootKey
```


> [!INFO] Why do you need a rootkey?
> Domain Controllers (DC) require a root key to begin generating gMSA passwords. The domain controllers will wait up to 10 hours from time of creation to allow all domain controllers to converge their AD replication before allowing the creation of a gMSA. Waiting up to 10 hours is a safety measure to prevent password generation from occurring before all DCs in the environment are capable of answering gMSA requests. Trying to use a gMSA too soon might fail when the gMSA host attempts to retrieve the password, as the key may not have been replicated to all domain controllers. gMSA password retrieval failures can also occur when using DCs with limited replication schedules or if there's a replication issue.


> [!IMPORTANT] Replication period
>Need to wait 10 hours before creating the gMSA account if KDS Root key is not available

## How many gMSA accounts do you need for MDI

It is recommended to have **2 gMSA accounts**. See MS note under: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/manage-action-accounts#create-and-configure-a-specific-action-account

 (Assuming this is a single domain environment. For multi-forest, read through this [document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/directory-service-accounts#two-or-more-dsa-entries-are-configured.) 
 
 With this, you need 2 accounts.
 
- Directory service account (Read permissions)
- Managed Action account (Write permissions) 

### (1) Directory service account

To manually create and assign permissions to the directory service account, follow the steps below: 
(Optionally ManagedPasswordIntervalInDays though it is default 30 anyway)

```powershell
New-ADServiceAccount -Name svc_mdi01 -DNSHostName yourdomain.local –Description "Microsoft Defender for Identity service account" –KerberosEncryptionType AES256 –ManagedPasswordIntervalInDays 30
```

Then confirm:

```powershell
Get-ADServiceAccount svc_mdi01 -Properties * | fl DNSHostName, SamAccountName, KerberosEncryptionType, ManagedPasswordIntervalInDays, PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword
```

And test:

```powershell
Test-ADServiceAccount -Identity 'svc_mdi01'
```

#### Assign permissions required for the DSA

> [!NOTE] Note
> - When granting permissions to gMSA accounts, you need a security group, add gMSA as member and add permissions to that group
> - `PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword` is assigned to the group that contains the domain controllers, or the default `'Domain Controllers'` group

Steps:
1. Create security group
2. Add gMSA account to the group
3. Take ownership on the deleted objects container (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/directory-service-accounts#permissions-required-for-the-dsa)
4. Grant `List Contents` and `Read Property` permissions to the group (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/directory-service-accounts#permissions-required-for-the-dsa)
5. Grant `Log on as a service` permission (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/directory-service-accounts#verify-that-the-gmsa-account-has-the-required-rights-if-needed)


#### (Optional) Install the gMSA account

> [!NOTE] Optional
> This is optional and only needed for password rotation mechanism. Totally fine to skip.

```powershell
# Import the required PowerShell module:
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

# Install the gMSA account
Install-ADServiceAccount -Identity 'svc_mdi01'
```

### (2) Manage action account

Essentially the same steps above to create it, except permissions are different.

1. Create the second gMSA account
2. Add the gMSA account to the group (created from first gMSA)
3. Grant `Logon as a service` permission to the account
4. Grant permissions to: (see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/manage-action-accounts#create-and-configure-a-specific-action-account)
	- To enable force password reset:
	    - Permissions:
	        - Reset password
	    - Properties:
	        - Read pwdLastSet
	        - Write pwdLastSet
	- To disable user:
	    - Properties:
	        - Read userAccountControl
	        - Write userAccountControl
	- (Optional) Select **Descendant Group objects** in the **Applies to** field and set the following properties:
	    - Read members
	    - Write members

### Script 

Script to create security group and grant read permissions https://gist.github.com/janeilagan/44aa121f3adec83e5cc9ce75fd0077f6

However, it doesn't grant permissions for manage action account (step 4 under [[#(2) Manage action account]]) and needs to be done manually.
