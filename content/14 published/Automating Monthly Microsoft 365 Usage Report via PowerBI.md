Like many Microsoft 365 Admins, I've faced the challenge of presenting monthly usage and adoption reports to clients in a way that's both informative and easy to understand. It's a common dilemma in our field, and I knew there had to be a better way. That's why I decided to create an automated monthly reporting solution using PowerBI.

This solution simplifies the reporting process and delivers the results in a client-friendly PDF format. It's designed to be accessible even for non-technical clients, providing them with a clear picture of their monthly Microsoft 365 usage and adoption statistics. It is a regular PowerBI template in `.pbit` extension, which can be setup once via Tenant ID and authenticating with at least Global Reader permissions. The report can be published online, and with Premium Per-User plan, can be subscribed to monthly scheduling of PDF reports and daily dataset refresh.

Here's a screenshot of the report delivered by my fictional company called Executive Cats specifically for its largest client, Intern Kittens.
