# everything is a draft

Source: https://stingingfly.org/2017/10/24/edit-lousy-writing/

So a writer might, for instance, have a specific house they remember from their youth that triggers specific memories for that writer. To capture this, they might write: ‘She stared at the old house. Her head filled with memories…’ Later, going back to edit this, they reread their own words: ‘She stared at the old house.’ Ah, yes! The words trigger the impulse that led to the words. They can see the specific house they have in mind; they see the dark green ivy covering a high window entirely, so the house looks one-eyed and piratical, they see the saplings and small bushes sprouting in the long-blocked, leaf-filled gutters, they see the ancient elm in the garden, leaning against the side of the house as though drunk. ‘Her head filled with memories…’ They read that, and, oh yes, they remember the first time they kissed someone they loved, in the shed out the back, and how amazing it felt. The sharp smell of cut grass and petrol rising from the still-warm lawnmower… They are having a marvellous time when they reread their draft.

But a reader who isn’t the writer just has the words provided on the page to go on: ‘She stared at the old house. Her head filled with memories…’ The reader has to fill in all the details. With nothing else to go on, they will tend to see a generic, rather featureless house. They might not give the house a garden at all. They will assign some vague and nonspecific memories. No colours, smells or sounds.

If your point-of-view character (the reader’s stand-in) walks into a small room with a dead bear in it, don’t be all cutesy and not tell us about the bear until we’re two pages in. Unless there’s a good reason not to, tell the reader what the point-of-view character would be struck by, as they’re struck by it.
