The spotlight effect is the psychological phenomenon by which people tend to believe they are being noticed more than they really are. Being that one is constantly in the center of one's own world, an accurate evaluation of how much one is noticed by others is uncommon. The reason for the spotlight effect is the innate tendency to forget that although one is the center of one's own world, one is not the center of everyone else's. This tendency is especially prominent when one does something atypical.



# ways to help

1. When starting to feel the spotlight effect, ask yourself “So what?” at least three to five times. It might help to verbalize this loudly to reaffirm yourself that everything is fine. 

2. Remember the study about spotlight effect where a group of college students. The researchers asked a number of students to wear an embarrassing shirt and estimate how many they think would notice it. The group wearing the shirt estimated 50% will notice it, but in reality it was just 25%. 

3. Remember that people are actually too preoccupied with their own lives to worry and notice you. You don’t notice everyone yourself, and you don’t care what fuck up someone did in between your day. No one thinks about you too when they’re preparing dinner and watching TVs with their family at night. And if then, “so what?”

4. We spend so much time thinking about what others think about us when really no one thinks about us at all. 

5. Most people don’t notice, and most of those who actually do probably don’t care. 


It’s a wonderful feeling when you share something you’ve been ashamed of with the world and realize no one cares.
