Thoughts:

Han Hyo Joo in suit and glasses is chef’s kiss 
Go Youn Jung as a teenager is super cute! 
Zo In Sung is effing handsome
Characters are well developed and back stories are properly filled out
Plot is a bit shallow though, not too much plot twists. 
Kilig factor for Hyo Joo and In Sung is astronomical- chemistry is off the roof. 

Bit tiring at the last 5 episodes, bit boring at some parts of backstories and characters that im not too much interested 
Not too gore, it’s manageable. 

Watched for the leads Hyo Joo In Sung and Youn Jung stayed for them too lol
