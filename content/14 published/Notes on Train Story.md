Insentra's Train Story:  [Insentra Train Story - Insentra Australia (insentragroup.com)](https://www.insentragroup.com/au/insights/not-geek-speak/business/insentra-train-story/)


I cant recall the last time I was this giddy about something. Maybe it was when I was just a kid and excited for the Christmas morning. Maybe it was the night before my parents told me we’re gonna be visiting the zoo back when I was seven. Being this nervous about something means it’s something I really want.

The moment I read the Train Story, I was hooked. I’ve read it another four to five times, I even made an offline copy of the website page for my phone. Working with outsourcing companies for as long as I can remember, I’ve always felt like we’re factories of knowledge and services which the companies use for profit. It’s not a bad thing, as I’m learning along the way.

But upon stumbling through Insentra’s values, I couldn’t believe there’s still a company that’s actually pro-employee. If the people who work on the train aren’t happy, the passengers won’t come back. And I like how it is that simple. I like how they value what others have already forgotten - honesty, integrity, trust. My grandmother had always said to find a guy with those values and marry him. (Well Grandma, I found a company, does that count?)

Being accountable for your actions, and celebrating the right things done. When efficiency doesn’t mean you’re underutilized. And service excellence internally will deliver service excellence externally. It’s like saying how you treat your workers will reflect on how they will treat your customers. And it shows.

One Team, One Dream - helping each other out and learning from each other. There will be things you know that your team doesn’t, and vice versa. Working as one means learning as one.

I love how the Train Story was well written. You’d know that it wasn’t written for promotion and marketing, because you can sense the feelings of it even through the screen. You can sense the thoughtfulness and honesty of it. It’s exciting to scroll through my phone reading it and seeing that the scrollbar has more to load - more to know about Insentra.

I even sent the link to few of my close friends asking them to read all through it- as it’s worth it.

It didn’t just motivate me to learn more, it motivated me to be a better version of myself. Knowing that there’s a possibility of joining a company that’s going to help me grow in all different ways, I didn’t want to miss the chance.

I’ve always been a technical kid growing up. When my mom bought her first phone, I was the first to learn it even though I’m just on second grade. I would always excel in computer subjects and eventually took Bachelor in Science of Information Technology. It excites me to learn how things work, how it makes life easier. It excites me to automate something and testing it and knowing it works. And when I found out that Insentra’s offering an opportunity to work and learn more about so many technologies, I wanted a ticket to board the train and go to places I’ve never been.

If there’s a carriage in the train that could fit me in, then I’m all aboard.
