- Sign-in risks - unfamiliar sign in, atypical travels, anonymous IPs

### Identity Protection 
- User risk policy
	- can allow access and require password change
- Sign in risk policy
	- doesn't work for password change, only require MFA
- multi-factor authentication registration policy (require azure ad mfa authentication registration)

### License requirement

- AAD P1 only has limited security reports, only users with medium and high risk are shown, no details for risky sign-ins report, and no details at all for risk detection report. 
- No notifications as well
- User, sign in, and MFA registration policies

### Simulate risky users and sign ins
- login to office account using TOR browser
![bdb7ea0122d27632503b9c7b779df4f2](https://i.imgur.com/HBJAm2S.png)

# Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

Originally: Microsoft Cloud App Security

CASB (Cloud Access Security Brokers)
- intermediary between users and cloud apps (somehow like a firewall)

## [Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-cloud-apps/what-is-defender-for-cloud-apps#the-defender-for-cloud-apps-framework)
1. Discover and Control the use of [Shadow IT](https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/shadow-it)
2. Protect sensitive information (provides DLP protection)
3. Protect against cyberthreats
4. Assess compliance

## Conditional Access App Controls
- allows BYOD whilst protecting corporate data
- integrates well with different cloud apps identity provider
- monitor and control user access to applications
- enforce access and session controls
	- prevent data exfiltration
	- protect on download
	- prevent upload of unlabeled files
	- monitor user sessions
	- block access and custom activities

## Phases of Defender for Cloud Apps

1. Discover data
	- apps should be connected to MDCA using application connector or conditional access app control
	- From portal.cloudappsecurity.com > Investigate > Connected Apps
2. Classify Sensitive Information
	- apply labels
	- From portal.cloudappsecurity.com > Settings > Information Protection > Microsoft Information Protection
	- ![01bdc2c23b24f0143b85b0dd26e04dd7](https://i.imgur.com/3MOIiZX.png)
3. Protect data
	- create file policies
	- From portal.cloudappsecurity.com > Control > Policies
	- can create file policies from templates (ie alert when sharing to personal emails, or stale shared files externally)
4. Monitor and report
	- use MDCA dashboard > Alerts > Incidents

Other notes: [[Onboard Office 365 to Defender for Cloud Apps]], [[Bulk-labelling SPO files using Defender for Cloud Apps]]


# Data Loss Prevention

## Remediating Alerts
- when Threats are detected, "Alerts" are generated
- Alerts are notifications
- Defender for cloud will prioritize and provide recommendations for alerts
- "Incidents" = collection of related alerts
- Cloud Smart Alert correlation technology is used to group the alerts

### How Defender for Cloud detects threats
- MS Security researches constantly looks for alerts
- MS has global presence in cloud and onprem
- Defender for Cloud can rapidly update detection algorithm

- Integrated Threat Intelligence (from MS Azure, M365, CRM Online, Dynamics AX, Outlook, MSN, Digital Crimes Units, MS Security Response Center)

- Anomaly Detection (baseline from requirements)

### How are alerts classified?
- High, Medium, Low, Informational
- assigned based on how confident defender is in the finding

### MITRE ATT&CK Tactics
- PreAttack - attempt to access resources, or failed attempt
- Initial Access - stage where attacker gets access to resources
- Persistence - maintain access and backdoor access
- Privilege Escalation - higher level of access
- Defense Evasion - avoid defenses 
- Credential access - gaining full control on systems / environment compromisation
- Discovery - gain knowledge on environment / what other resources they can access
- Lateral Movement - move around the network, may be using scripts to extract more info
- Execution - execute codes on local or remote systems
- Collection - collecting data / gathering sensitive information
- Exfiltration - important/critical data
- Command & Control - full access to network, access resources
- Impact - reduce the availability, or shut down environment, reduce integrity

### Remediating Alerts
- Defender for Cloud > Alerts > Click on alert to see additional details
- Take action options
	- Mitigate the threat
	- Prevent future attacks
	- Triger automated response 
	- Suppress similar alerts
