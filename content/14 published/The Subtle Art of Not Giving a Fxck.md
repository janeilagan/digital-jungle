CHAPTER 1: Don’t Try, p. 6

It is then strange that on Bukowski’s tombstone, the epitaph reads: “Don’t try.”

The Feedback Loop from Hell, p. 10

Our crisis is no longer material; it’s existential, it’s spiritual.

June 29, 2022

The Feedback Loop from Hell, p. 11

The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.

June 29, 2022

The Feedback Loop from Hell, p. 12

Don’t try.

June 29, 2022

The Feedback Loop from Hell, p. 12

when you care less about something, you do better at it?

June 29, 2022

The Feedback Loop from Hell, p. 12

The avoidance of suffering is a form of suffering. The avoidance of struggle is a struggle

June 29, 2022

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 14

You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere.

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 15

Subtlety #1: Not giving a fuck does not mean being indifferent; it means being comfortable with being different.

June 29, 2022

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 16

They say, “Fuck it,” not to everything in life, but rather to everything unimportant in life

June 29, 2022

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 16

because they reserve their fucks for only the big things that matter

June 29, 2022

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 17

Subtlety #2: To not give a fuck about adversity, you must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 18

life problems” are really just side effects of not having anything more important to worry about.

June 29, 2022

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 18

Because if you don’t find that meaningful something, your fucks will be given to meaningless and frivolous causes.

June 29, 2022

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 18

Subtlety #3: Whether you realize it or not, you are always choosing what to give a fuck about.

June 29, 2022

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 18

Those people whose opinions we cared about so much before are no longer present in our lives

June 29, 2022

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 18

We realize how little attention people pay to the superficial details about us, and we choose not to obsess so much over them.

we accept ourselves, including some of the parts we aren’t thrilled about

June 29, 2022

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, p. 18

Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy

June 29, 2022

So Mark, What the Fuck Is the Point of This Book Anyway?, p. 19

Don’t try.

June 29, 2022

So Mark, What the Fuck Is the Point of This Book Anyway?, p. 19

Because when we believe that it’s not okay for things to suck sometimes, then we unconsciously start blaming ourselves. We start to feel as though something is inherently wrong with us, which drives us to all sorts of overcompensation, like buying forty pairs of shoes or downing Xanax with a vodka chaser on a Tuesday night or shooting up a school bus full of kids.

So Mark, What the Fuck Is the Point of This Book Anyway?, p. 20

some suffering is always inevitable

June 29, 2022

The Misadventures of Disappointment Panda

One of those realizations was this: that life itself is a form of suffering. The rich suffer because of their riches. The poor suffer because of their poverty. People without a family suffer because they have no family. People with a family suffer because of their family. People who pursue worldly pleasures suffer because of their worldly pleasures. People who abstain from worldly pleasures suffer because of their abstention.

June 29, 2022

The Misadventures of Disappointment Panda

Happiness is not a solvable equation.

June 29, 2022

The Misadventures of Disappointment Panda

Sure, making a lot of money makes you feel good, but it won’t make your kids love you

June 29, 2022

The Misadventures of Disappointment Panda

What you consider ‘friendship’ is really just your constant attempts to impress people.”

June 29, 2022

The Misadventures of Disappointment Panda

After all, the greatest truths in life are usually the most unpleasant to hear

June 29, 2022

The Misadventures of Disappointment Panda

We are wired to become dissatisfied with whatever we have and satisfied by only what we do not have

It is nature’s preferred agent for inspiring change

Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

The solution to one problem is merely the creation of the next one.”

June 29, 2022

Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

Don’t hope for a life without problems,” the panda said. “There’s no such thing. Instead, hope for a life full of good problems.

Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

Definitely re-read this!

June 29, 2022

Happiness Comes from Solving Problems

You don’t find it waiting for you in a place, an idea, a job—or even a book, for that matter.

June 29, 2022

Emotions Are Overrated

Remember, nobody who is actually happy has to stand in front of a mirror and tell himself that he’s happy.

June 29, 2022

Emotions Are Overrated

negative emotions are a call to action

June 29, 2022

Choose Your Struggle

You know who bases their entire lives on their emotions? Three-year-old kids. And dogs. You know what else three-year-olds and dogs do? Shit on the carpet.

June 29, 2022

Choose Your Struggle

A fixation on happiness inevitably amounts to a never-ending pursuit of “something else

June 29, 2022

Choose Your Struggle

hedonic treadmill”: the idea that we’re always working hard to change our life situation, but we actually never feel very different.

June 29, 2022

Choose Your Struggle

The dream job you take is the job you stress over.

Oh wow?

June 29, 2022

Choose Your Struggle

Because happiness requires struggle.

June 29, 2022

Choose Your Struggle

What determines your success isn’t, “What do you want to enjoy?” The relevant question is, “What pain do you want to sustain?”

June 29, 2022

Choose Your Struggle

Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who fly to the top of it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainties of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.

CHAPTER 3: You Are Not Special, p. 56

The truth is that there’s no such thing as a personal problem. If you’ve got a problem, chances are millions of other people have had it in the past, have it now, and are going to have it in the future. Likely people you know too. That doesn’t minimize the problem or mean that it shouldn’t hurt. It doesn’t mean you aren’t legitimately a victim in some circumstances. It just means that you’re not special. Often, it’s this realization—that you and your problems are actually not privileged in their severity or pain—that is the first and most important step toward solving them.

Things Fall Apart

1.   I’m awesome and the rest of you all suck, so I deserve special treatment. 2.   I suck and the rest of you are all awesome, so I deserve special treatment.

June 29, 2022

CHAPTER 3: You Are Not Special

It turns out that merely feeling good about yourself doesn’t really mean anything unless you have a good reason to feel good about yourself.

June 29, 2022

CHAPTER 3: You Are Not Special

Entitled people exude a delusional degree of self-confidence.

June 29, 2022

Things Fall Apart

People who are entitled delude themselves into whatever feeds their sense of superiority.

Potentially me

The Tyranny of Exceptionalism

This flood of extreme information has conditioned us to believe that exceptionalism is the new normal

B-b-b-but, If I’m Not Going to Be Special or Extraordinary, What’s the Point?

A lot of people are afraid to accept mediocrity because they believe that if they accept it, they’ll never achieve anything, never improve, and that their life won’t matter.

June 30, 2022

B-b-b-but, If I’m Not Going to Be Special or Extraordinary, What’s the Point?

Your actions actually don’t matter that much in the grand scheme of things”

June 30, 2022

The Self-Awareness Onion

Why do I consider this to be success/failure? How am I choosing to measure myself? By what standard am I judging myself and everyone around me?

June 30, 2022

B-b-b-but, If I’m Not Going to Be Special or Extraordinary, What’s the Point?

The vast majority of your life will be boring and not noteworthy, and that’s okay.”

June 30, 2022

Shitty Values

But if you’re sitting pretty in the middle class in a developed country, an extra ten thousand dollars per year won’t affect anything much—meaning that you’re killing yourself working overtime and weekends for basically nothing.

June 30, 2022

Shitty Values

As humans, we’re wrong pretty much constantly, so if your metric for life success is to be right—well, you’re going to have a difficult time rationalizing all of the bullshit to yourself.

June 30, 2022

Shitty Values

It’s simple, really: things go wrong, people upset us, accidents happen. These things make us feel like shit. And that’s fine. Negative emotions are a necessary component of emotional health. To deny that negativity is to perpetuate problems rather than solve them.

June 30, 2022

Shitty Values

But the anger is not the problem.

June 30, 2022

Defining Good and Bad Values

Side Note: As a rule, people who are terrified of what others think about them are actually terrified of all the shitty things they think about themselves being reflected back at them.)

June 30, 2022

Defining Good and Bad Values

This, in a nutshell, is what “self-improvement” is really about: prioritizing better values, choosing better things to give a fuck about. Because when you give better fucks, you get better problems. And when you get better problems, you get a better life.

July 5, 2022

There Is No “How”

You are already choosing, in every moment of every day, what to give a fuck about, so change is as simple as choosing to give a fuck about something else. It really is that simple. It’s just not easy.

June 30, 2022

The Choice

This is the realization that we, individually, are responsible for everything in our lives, no matter the external circumstances

July 1, 2022

The Responsibility/Fault Fallacy

He likely wasn’t even aware that he was choosing his value (or could do so).

Then what are my values?

July 1, 2022

The Responsibility/Fault Fallacy

This is because you always get to choose how you see things, how you react to things, how you value things

July 1, 2022

Genetics and the Hand We’re Dealt

Or I could choose a better problem, working on practicing patience,

July 5, 2022

There Is No “How”

Next, you’ll feel like a failure. You’ve spent half your life measuring yourself by that old value, so when you change your priorities, change your metrics, and stop behaving in the same way, you’ll fail to meet that old, trusted metric and thus immediately feel like some sort of fraud or nobody. This is also normal and also uncomfortable

July 5, 2022

CHAPTER 6: You’re Wrong About Everything (But So Am I)

Every step of the way I was wrong. About everything. Throughout my life, I’ve been flat-out wrong about myself, others, society, culture, the world, the universe—everything. And I hope that will continue to be the case for the rest of my life.

The Dangers of Pure Certainty

It’s the backwards law again: the more you try to be certain about something, the more uncertain and insecure you will feel. But the converse is true as well: the more you embrace being uncertain and not knowing, the more comfortable you will feel in knowing what you don’t know.

July 6, 2022

Architects of Our Own Beliefs

Instead of striving for certainty, we should be in constant search of doubt: doubt about our own beliefs, doubt about our own feelings, doubt about what the future may hold for us unless we get out there and create it for ourselves. Instead of looking to be right all the time, we should be looking for how we’re wrong all the time. Because we are.

Too much of this turns you into an anxious being

July 6, 2022

Architects of Our Own Beliefs

Being wrong opens us up to the possibility of change. Being wrong brings the opportunity for growth.

July 10, 2022

The Dangers of Pure Certainty

Many people have an unshakable certainty in their ability at their job or in the amount of salary they should be making. But that certainty makes them feel worse, not better. They see others getting promoted over them, and they feel slighted. They feel unappreciated and underacknowledged.

July 10, 2022

Manson’s Law of Avoidance

The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.

July 10, 2022

Kill Yourself

My recommendation: don’t be special; don’t be unique. Redefine your metrics in mundane and broad ways. Choose to measure yourself not as a rising star or an undiscovered genius. Choose to measure yourself not as some horrible victim or dismal failure.

July 10, 2022

How to Be a Little Less Certain of Yourself

This often means giving up some grandiose ideas about yourself: that you’re uniquely intelligent, or spectacularly talented, or intimidatingly attractive, or especially victimized in ways other people could never imagine. This means giving up your sense of entitlement and your belief that you’re somehow owed something by this world. This means giving up the supply of emotional highs that you’ve been sustaining yourself on for years. Like a junkie giving up the needle, you’re going to go through withdrawal when you start giving these things up. But you’ll come out the other side so much better.
