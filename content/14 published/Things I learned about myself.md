- [[Learn that im not in a spotlight]]
- [[if someones criticism got into me]]
- [[the less we are able to express the more unwell we get]]
- [[dont let fear control your life]]
- [[try not to be a total worker]]
- [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]]
- [[The Universe is not in a hurry]]
- [[we'll be dead soon]]
- [[we spend so much time thinking about what others think when no one really does]]
- [[imposter syndrome]]
- [[just show up]]
- [[The Four Agreements]]
