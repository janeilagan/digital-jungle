Notes: 

[03:46](https://youtu.be/L9SLlxaEEXY#t=226.3980799141693) | Everything is knowledge 
- your brain is for ideas, not for holding things

[13:06](https://youtu.be/L9SLlxaEEXY#t=786.7111429713898) | linking notes to another ideas

Notes:

[02:13](https://youtu.be/rOSZOCoqOo8#t=133.8445128664856) | the more information = more hooks | more connected information means more cues to trigger the right memory

ASK:
- how does this fit to things I already know
- can I use other words or terms to explain this properly
- how can I use this to explain another idea

[02:51](https://youtu.be/rOSZOCoqOo8#t=171.76296) |  finding keywords aren't about how to create notes 

(and how you're obsessing about where to put things, what templates to use, how to ensure your devices are syncing, etc)

it is ==how to retrieve the notes!==

(stop trying to categorize things, or fit it to a category)

instead, ask yourself when would I need this note again, or how will I use this idea?

[03:36](https://youtu.be/rOSZOCoqOo8#t=216.75965210490418) |  take fleeting notes. temporary ideas, temporary notes, and review in few days to develop as permanent notes

[04:08](https://youtu.be/rOSZOCoqOo8#t=248.95620304005433) | see what's missing, see what questions to ask

[04:26](https://youtu.be/rOSZOCoqOo8#t=266.28550895803835) | transform to more coherent notes

Resource: [Zettelkasten Method With Obsidian- How to Take Smart Notes(With Examples) | by Prakash Joshi Pax | Medium](https://beingpax.medium.com/zettelkasten-method-with-obsidian-how-to-take-smart-notes-with-examples-cdaf348febbd)

Notes:

Zettelkasten system becomes more and more valuable as it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing.

Nobody ever really starts from scratch - there's always something there already, an existing preconception, which can be transformed if proper questions are asked. 

- fleeting notes should end up in trash in a day or two - (you're supposed to develop the notes you prick)
- literature notes anything read, heard, watched, gotten from someone else.  (write things in your own words even though you tend to just copy things as is. at least place the link of where you got it.)
- permanent notes --think about how things relate to what the hell you're trying to achieve. 
	- develop ideas - when would I need this note again
	- arguments - see what questions to ask

If creating a note is laborious, you won’t do it, and you’ll lose all those great ideas.
