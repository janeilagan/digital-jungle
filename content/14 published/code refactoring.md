Refactor in accordance with the Rule of 3:
The first time you are doing something, just get it done, even if it’s with dirty code, so the software functions as needed.
The second time you’re doing a similar change, you can do it again the same way – you’ll know it a little better, so you may be speedier but the code still won’t be perfectly clean.
When you encounter this change for the third time, start refactoring.
