# foreword

*i can't say anything to your face, cause look at your face*



previously: general fiction because that's all we're ever gonna be

now: poetry that you didn't think it would be

---

# i know you and i don't

okay maybe i stay a little too late at night stalking your profile

or maybe i stare at you a little too long than what's normal

and maybe, i'm hyper-aware of everything you say or you do

because maybe, i have this little tiny bit of crush on you

---

# then again it's unrequited

then i saw you enter the room  

shy eyes and glint of boredom  

your scent knocking the air out of me  

like my personal favorite brand of tea


it's thrilling and exhilarating just how  

my range of vocabulary reduced to wow  

with one word at the tip of my tongue  

emotions long gone, then again sprung

you resemble a calm, serene, good spirit  

what you're doing to me's opposite  

tornadoes, hurricanes, winds from west  

my heart's playing hopscotch in my chest

---

# saw you from a distance

it's too early to say that i like you, but i do

slightly infatuated over every little thing you say

or every little thing you do

and every time i learn something new about you

i knew

i'm screwed

---

# i heard your voice

i died

your voice is both halcyon and forlorn 

it felt like sweet liquid trickling down a honeysuckle bud

the greatest aphrodisiac in the most innocent way

---

# the atheist and the believer

i didn't say i don't believe in Him

i just don't believe in human-made religion

and i had to shut my mouth when i say *oh my God*

because you kept on reminding me not to swear on His name


---

# your gorgeous face and 3.3 GPA

just when i thought you were all just a pretty face

i'd open your profile to see your previous grades

and just when i thought you ain't into poetry

i'd see you like *faudet*, and i'm falling uncontrollably

---

# what your fingers can do 

is there anything you aren't good at?

you pluck my innermost desires like you pluck the strings of your guitar

and you press all my buttons like you play the keys of your electric keyboard

tell me, is there really anything you aren't good at?

---

# front row seat

then i'm drunk and you're not

and i got the front-row seat

seeing people flirt with you, stare at you

yet i can't even come out to you

i don't want us to be awkward

yet my drunk ass still lead to that

# infatuated

i told myself it was only an infatuation

but then i started to hear your voice in my favourite songs

i swear i can taste you in my favourite tea

and to hell, you started to creep into my poetry

as i try to find all the reasons not to like you

i found myself failing miserably 

---

# nineteen twenty-five

the funny thing is;

when said you missed me

and all the words in my vocabulary were lost to oblivion

---

# in too deep

there's this feeling creeping through my insides

from my stomach working its way to my heart

those secret glances i throw hoping you wouldn't notice

but when i hear you talk, i lose focus


you bat your eyelashes, i look away

you purse your lips, it's not fair how you play

all my excuses just to be near you

when i know there's never gonna be *me and you

---

# so bad

you like boys, i like you

there's this tune i found, reminded me of you

you stood in front of me, for what felt like an eternity

my soul aching for something that's never for me

---

# never enough

white pages painted with black ink of words i'm trying to use

skimming dictionaries, thesauri and all of those word books

nothing would do justice, no adjective can spell it out

sighing, i can never write enough to sum you up

---

# recipe for disaster

be a girl, like a straight girl

from a distance, look at her

sit beside her, laugh. be her friend

keep the butterflies concealed till the very end

---

# i'd do it

i realized i'd do anything for you

you could ask me to jump and i'd ask how high

---

# someday

  
**someday**  
*adv.* [at some time in the future]

**i.** it's funny how you're the first one i look for every sunday, wednesday, and thursday. two hours each day. never more. usually less. you're there. just there. i can see, but i can never reach.

**ii.** it's the small, blue paper taped at the side of my desk with your name in a red ink, a smiley below it. you joked you'd be an actress and that i should get your autograph, but you didn't know i stare at your handwriting more than what's healthy. it's there. just there. mocking me.

**iii.** there's a burning feeling inside my chest. it's there. just there.

**iv.** and i wonder, maybe someday, i can tell you this.

# chords


i strummed the guitar, strings vibrating with the sound of the sea

but all that's in my head is your fingers doing the chord of G

i pressed the black keys of the piano, and the tone echoes

but slithering in my memories, your voice, this is how it goes

---

# bewitched

your laugh sounds like a purple lilac

swaying to the gush of the wind

holding my attention captive

your smell is an elixir

driving me to fucking madness

# scintilla

you are a living pastiche, every artist would wish they made

a mellifluous piece, mozart would have written for a decade

it's funny how you turn my stomach into a series of labyrinths

you put Daedalus to shame, could've given him some hints

---

# why bother

why do i even bother writing this  

when you won't even fucking notice  

why do i even think it's gonna happen  

when i know this territory is completely foreign?

---

# you knew

i don't know what to feel  

you knew i'm crushing hard on you  

and you just brushed it off like it doesn't matter
