# what is imposter syndrome
the persistent inability to believe that one's success is deserved or has been legitimately achieved as a result of one's own efforts or skills.

## personal experience

For the past few weeks, I had learned that there are certain situations where I feel dumb, question my abilities, question if i deserve the things i have now, not believing i deserve anything good in the world, i dont know a lot, I tend to downplay what I do especially when i know i could have done better and learned that maybe, I'm experiencing imposter syndrome.

## where it comes from
From this article, it is stated it could potentially root from parenting and childhood environment, especially when your parents:

- pressured you to do well in school
- compared you to your sibling(s)
- were controlling or overprotective
- emphasized your natural intelligence
- sharply criticized mistakes

And wow, 5/5!

It's also stated that it could be from:

-   [perfectionistic tendencies](https://www.healthline.com/health/perfectionism)
-   low self-efficacy, or confidence in your ability to manage your behavior and successfully handle your responsibilities
-   higher scores on measures of neuroticism, aÂ [big five personality trait](https://www.healthline.com/health/big-five-personality-traits)
-   lower scores on measures of conscientiousness, another big five trait

I don't have any prior knowledge about the big five personality trait yet, so this looks like a 2/4

## what can i do to battle this

Over the years, what I would always do is I tend to overcompensate in the area I feel like I'm a fraud. I would over deliver for what's asked of me, I would try and cram - trying to learn as much as I can about the subject so I would be knowledgeable and I would know what I originally didn't.

They said the first thing is acknowledging your feelings, and I'm not sure what comes next, but whilst I'm in the process of getting to know myself, I would continue to journal the things I didn't really realise I do/think, and find ways on how to help myself moving forward.
