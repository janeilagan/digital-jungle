# poetry

how can someone who inhales air breathe out poetry  

how can someone so soft cause you a terrible tragedy  

how can someone you knew was trouble became your serenity  

how can someone like you tame the living beast inside of me?

# this is why we cant have nice things

she was too good for me and im afraid i'd suck all the goodness in her  

i was used to toxic, she was too healthy  

i was used to getting pushed down, she was pushing me up  

and im afraid, because i know me  

and all i do is break nice things

---

# keep you

im starting to feel something for someone  

and i told myself i wont write about it  

i told myself i'll never write about her  

so this would be the last thing i'll write about you  

hey, i really really want to keep you.

---

# go

and this is where it ends  

im gonna start writing about you  

im gonna start missing you  

then im letting you go  

go


---

# worth

and all my friends kept saying you don't deserve me  

but then why do i feel like im not worthy enough for you?


---

# burn

you realized you're so fucked up when you found out she can burn you with her touches

---

# hick-yes

heart shaped hickey on your neck  

lips swollen, wounded, scarred  

bodies blended as one  

yes, yes, yes

---

# more

she tasted like something you never tasted before  

and you're addicted  

craving for more, craving for more

---

# home

you're trying to find her scent in everything  

you tried every perfume in the mall  

you tried all the clothes in your drawer  

you tried the flower shops, the morning dew, the coffee shop you always go to  

but nothing smelled her  

for she smells like home

---

# glitch

we are each other's glitches


---

# fix


she would kiss the scars like she's amazed by them  

she would touch my broken pieces like they're diamond shards  

she's not trying to fix me  

she never would

---

# 30

you fell in love with a girl who says life starts at thirty  

it's funny because you planned to end yours at that

---

# agnostic

and you found refuge in her body  

safety in her kiss, safety in her touch  

and you're not even religious  

yet when your body touches hers  

you swear to God

---

# pain

have you ever wondered, babe  

why i moan when you bruise my lips  

why my breath hitches when you dig your nails  

why my eyes roll back when you grip my neck

---

# 28

with a font size of twenty eight  

printed on the page that is your skin  

a period, no, an exclamation mark  

warning others  

of where my mouth has been  

of what my tongue had tasted  

of where my fingers had been deep

---

# breathing

my hands on your thighs  

your hands on my face  

we're doing the same thing  

keeping each other still

my mouth on your hardened bud  

your fingers caught in my hair  

we're doing the same thing  

keeping our breathing even

i gather your sweet taste with my lips  

you close your eyes as i did  

we're doing the same thing  

both our hearts convulsing

---

# skin tissue

knuckle deep into the tightest part of you  

yet i want to push deeper  

it's selfish, isnt it?  

when i want to take that from you  

i promised not to break your heart  

but i wanna tear that skin tissue apart

---

# venn diagrams

and sometimes id draw  

venn diagrams  

of why we aren't meant to be

---

# storms

i'd destroy you and leave ruins in your wake

and you'd understand why they call storms after people names

---

# different

you were different

good different

i hate difference

but with you

i suddenly knew

different is good

---

# deep

you smiled widely at me

even when i told you to leave

baby,

that's when i knew 

i had fallen in deep

---

# home

i still hasn't slept on my bed ever since you left

i'm afraid i'd smell you in my sheets and do an impulsive thing

you know,

quit my job and run after you

-you are my home-


---

# oasis

i found an oasis in the rift between your legs  

but it made me thirstier  

so i drowned in the torrent  

when you drenched me deeper

---

# thoughts

do you have an idea how much i think about you?

how much i stare at your pictures, how many replays i have watched of those cute videos of yours?

do you have an idea how much i miss your face every single day i'm away from you?

i miss you


---

# words

i would always run out of words on how to explain my feelings for you

so i badly wish you fell it from when i kiss your lips 

from when i hug you tight

form when i sing to you good night

---

# it's okay babe

It's always gonna be an "it's okay, babe."

Always gonna be "no worries, go ahead."

Everytime you do things we know i hate,

You know I'll always bend and break my rules for you, babe.

It will always be "im good, take your time."

It's always "yeah, okay, it's fine."

And even if I didn't do anything wrong,

You'd probably hear me repeat "sorry" like a song.

I love the way your hair looked today. You kept it long because you found out I like girls with long hair. But I loved it too the day we first met. It's cut just up to your shoulders and the other side was longer. The first day I met you, you took my breath away. But I'm not gonna talk about something I've told you million times before.

There are times that I'm not sure what I want. Times when I think I don't want anyone else but my solace. I know you feel it. But you would never let me alone with my thoughts. Just like I asked you even before we started dating. Because you know me. So well.

There are times your touch burns my skin it hurts. I don't want to get near you. I don't want you two feet near me. But you patiently wait until it doesn't hurt anymore to touch me, and would patiently wait until you can cherish me with your love. You know me. So well.

You've been patient with me. Our relationship was never perfect. But you looked at it like it's the best thing in the world. It is, for me. You gave me strength with the irony that you're my weakness. You're always there for me. Not once, that you gave up on me, on us.

I love you. Always. All ways.

# dearest

Dearest,

Do you, my beloved, have a slight inkling of how you remoulded this existence of mine many would call a life?

For years I’m a walking catastrophe, reeling storms and destruction in paths I walked through. For years I’m a suppressed soul, a beast no one can tame.

But then you came, your entirety of amazingness, engrossing the deepest abyss of my thoughts. Yet, a writer I am with words as my sword, my trustworthy weapon fails me, for no phrase that comes in mind could possibly do justice – none – of what I feel for you.

Your eyes glisten of innocence; undisclosed to the wrath of the world. There’s magic on your luscious lips I dare not to explain, yet should try: *enchanted*. 

For how words that emanates out of it makes me hold my breath – and do the same when it touches mine. I’d willingly clutch it longer yearning it’ll linger for a lifetime.

Your touch spreads a sensation in me – of what’s like a forest fire, burning me up from the inside. I am mesmerized, in awe, and indebted, for Cupid decided to string our fates together. 

Love, this letter is a failure, an absolute absurdity, for it can never illustrate the adoration buried in my heart for you. 

This shall I do, to the crack of doom, I shall follow you.

Forever.

A

# push and pull

It's gonna be a series of push and pull.

I'd push you away. I'd tell you I don't deserve you.

I'd pull you back, because I'm selfish and I want to keep you.

I'd push you away. Because you deserve all the good in the world.

I'd pull you back, cos only you can keep me from being cold.

I'd push you away. Asking to please never come in my way.

I'd pull you back. Begging on my knees for you to stay.
