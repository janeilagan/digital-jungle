^893bd1


I tried to sleep, you’re keeping me awake

With all your words, to me are fake

I don’t even know which ones are real

Even if it's not, let’s make a deal

I’ll fall in love but you’ll catch me 

I’ll laugh with you, but you’ll love me 

It wasn’t the first time I'd felt this way

But I hope you respond to what I’ll say

You were in my dreams when I sleep at night

You’re on my mind when I’m awake at my might

In every song, I hear your voice

I hope I’m not one of your so-called toys

I know it’s not that deep but we’ll get there

It'll take a while, but we'll get somewhere

As I write this note, I’m thinking of you

I hope you feel the same way I do

# three words

I am guilty

Guilty for promises I promised I’ll make

For times that I said I’ll be there

For moments that I should be where you were

I feel sorry

For things I didn't mean to do

For the trust you've given but I lost too

For the memories we could have done but we didn't

I’m not okay

Cause I’m feeling so much guilt and worry

Because I know I’ve been awfully bad

And because I know I’ve made you feel sad

I can't sleep

I can't think of anything I can offer

Because I know time is all you wanted

But I can't almost have that for myself

I’m really confused

I don't know what I should do

Or even think how I can make this up to you

All I can promise is to be here always for you

I love you

I just can't find words to say

Or things I’ll make t prove it anyway

Cause you've done enough but I just went away

# broken

As I turned slowly, I saw your face

You walked towards me, I am amazed

I felt joy, the feeling that I missed

But pain creeps out, on my chest amidst.

I know it’s broken, nothing I can do

To fix it, mend it, but know I tried to

Like a piece of paper, trust was crumpled

Like a glass of water, poured and bubbled

I tried to smile but it seems so hard

Expecting return, but didnt had

You passed through me, like I’m a thin air

Like Im not there, it was so unfair.

Is it really broken? I asked myself

Was that the ending of the book in shelf?

I turned the pages, the last one’s gloomy

It’s hard to say, but it ended sadly

# the first day, i thought

^80284c



Time moves agonizingly slow

No right words ought to follow 

Feeling like my body is trapped

Nowhere to go, in this hell, I'm stuck


Time moves a little bit faster 

But still every minute, I want to surrender

Time moves a little too fast

And yet I can't forget about our past


Hearts beat calm and slow

Distinct voices in our past, they echo

Like a show, I watched the credits fade away 

Moving, nothing to do, nothing to say


Day one, and yet it felt like forever

You wondered if this pain will never be over

And even when you knew you can move on

You still stare at his face through the phone


How long would you suffer, you ask? 

How long do you have to wear that mask?

You fell asleep, bringing all the pain 

To the abyss of memories, unending rain

# the second day, i knew

^a7f690

He lost the pendant you had given him

Along with your trust, respect, all that within

Shattered and broken, might never be fixed 

Was it all worth it, after all the risks?

He strings you along in false pretense

Kisses you hard to make it make some sense

In his eyes, your reflection ghostly lies

You wonder how long he can keep his disguise

He expected you to believe his plea 

When his promises replay agonizingly

He's on his knees, begging you to understand

But you knew deep inside, your love can't withstand

From the beginning he knew every single doubt

Happenstance from his past and how they sprout

If it was that easy for him to promise *them* forever

How did he expect you to believe you'll end up together?

# the third day, i wondered

^287800

Your toothbrush, with mine, still on my dock

No one understands how these feelings suck

In every glance, in every action I make

I remember your face in each breath I take

I'm beginning to panic my heart racing fast

It's starting to sink in that our love will not last

Everytime you ask me if we can stay as friends

I'm reliving the exact moment it all suspends

Was I never enough, will I ever see why?

Your reason for ending it, was that a lie?

Insecurity had started to creep deep in me

Unable to return to how I used to be


---

# the last day, i stopped

^18994b


It's been too long since our goodbye

It's funny how it went, all reasons why

It's been a while since we chose to stay

Now we can't even talk and say 'hey'


From everything that happened, were you fine?

I found myself wondering if you were ever mine

We're not friends, nor enemies,

Just two strangers with shared memories


I often wonder if what we had was fake

I don't have a clue how long it will take

For both our souls to find their way

Hoping to be together, hoping it'll be okay


It's been too long since our first hello

Since we both basked through its afterglow

It's been a while since you chose to leave

Leaving both our hearts to grieve

# to that girl

To the girl who used to eat my food, sleep on my bed, wearing my clothes, hugging my pillow, hiding under my blanket and used to be my best friend, I wanna raise a question. How did we fall out? 

I used to know everything about you. Your likes, your dreams, your pretty little fears. I used to brush your hair, scratch your back, we were once a solid pack. I wanna raise a question. Why did we fall out?

I used to like Taylor Swift (I still do) it took you time to appreciate her but for me you do. I used to listen to Demi Lovato (I still do) you have her songs in the memory card I gave you. I used to know your favorite songs, you used to sing me to sleep with my comfort songs, I wanna raise a question. When did we fall out?  

It's been past a year since we stayed up late. It's been past a year, since i formed that hate. The last time I stayed long in your house, the last time you crawled in my bed to nap, makes me wanna raise a question. Where did we fall out?  

I know you knew, no one else knows you like I do.  I felt bad that you lied to me, but i already forgave you. So can i raise one more question, after all that's been between us, can we go back to the sisterhood we once had?

*(please, i was a kid here)*

# meteorite

^f5237f


Careless whispers surround the night

Stars twinkle under the foggy twilight 

A shooting star emerged, giving a sight

Kindling my heart like a candlelight

You were seen in sight, but unreachable like heaven

Two feet away, yet too distant to happen

Longing for your closeness is what I had wished 

Before the unpredictable meteor vanished


Surrounded by distractions that fill us afar

Crowded, yet emptiness is all that we are

Sleepy eyelids fluttering to dream

Yet somehow your eyes still shine agleam


As I bade goodbye, I pray you walk me home

Like when we used to, in this small town, roam

It used to be us, tonight you latch unto them

Our secret foregone, we have long condemned

---

# turn it up

And this is a thing you should know

I hate you up to my core

It isn’t real that

I love you more

And honestly I feel like

you’re the worst person 

and

that I hate you.

Don’t assume to yourself

that you’re okay for me.

Unless you turn things around you’ll see.

(Read from bottom to top.)

# when summer and autumn collided

^1dd8b6

An eighteen-day gap on our twin-month birthday

You were born Friday, I was on the last Tuesday

Same month, same year, yet two different signs

And fate brought us to meet as the stars conspire


Alone in one room, with everything as the difference

I’m autumn equinox, you’re summer solstice

Your straight black hair, my curly brown undone

And next to my long fingers, crossed your small, little ones


I looked at your eyes, speaking into mine

Your lips quivering, like you were about to cry

We looked at each other, and then we realized

The difference is too different, we're no longer surprised


Does "I love you" still count after goodbye?

Can it bring it all back every time we cry?

We thought we'll forever have each other's side

But all along our signs were telling us we'll never collide

# little things

Thank you. For the little things. For making me smile when i feel like crying. For easing the pain im dealing. For tasting foods you never wanted to eat just for me. For laughing at my jokes even if it isn't funny. For seeing me everytime you're missing me, and for telling me that i am beautiful. It is those little things that you do that makes me fall more and more in love with you. Thank you. Thank you for making me feel like im the luckiest girl in the world. For making me feel bad but great. For making me feel the love i was once searching. For taking care of me, and making sure im safe. For holding my hands whenever needed. For never letting go. For cooking food for me, serving me like im a princess. For never making me do things i never want to do, and for knowing every little piece of me. For letting me sleep in your shoulder anytime, anywhere, and holding my head to make sure it doesnt fall. For trying to make things up for me whenever you did wrong. Thank you for the little things. For tucking me to sleep, hugging me tight. For making sure no one crush me whenever we're on train. For holding my waist to make sure i dont fall, for kissing my forehead anywhere we go. For taking me home even at midnight just to make sure im okay. For being my guy best friend. For sharing all your stories i know you dont share with anyone. Thank you. For understanding my attitude, for staying even i asked you to go. 

*(i was dramatic back then)*
