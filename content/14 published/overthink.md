It’s so interesting how some people are unapologetically themselves to others and then there’s the rest of us who are constantly overthinking about how we come across.

Stop the [[Egocentrism]] because other people might not be thinking or feeling the same way as you. You’re probably beating yourself too much over something that others have never cared about. 

---

Don’t be so hard on yourself. Don’t try so hard to please others. Relax and enjoy life more. 

---

Redirect yourself to something you learned over the experience and what you can do next. 

---

If you have different standard for yourself than others, you are not seeing things clearly. 

---

You’ll hurt people on some level, it’s unavoidable. They can deal with it, or ask you to apologize if necessary. Recover gracefully and humbly when it inevitably happens.

If you’re not thinking and judging others, they’re probably the same. We’re all focused on ourselves. You are not in a [[Learn that im not in a spotlight|spotlight]]. No one cares about what you said. 

---

Think about what you feel when someone else did what you did. Did you care? If you didn’t, they probably don’t too. 

---

It wasn’t the end of the world. You’ll survive.
