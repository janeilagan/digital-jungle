# chaos


In the beginning, there was nothing.

Neither dark or bright, it was haunting.

Nothing exists, not a single asteroid.

Vacancy of chasms. A complete void.

Warm bed sheets, foggy bathroom mirror

Staring at her empty eyes, the face she abhors

It was a state of endless falling, in all direction

Ceasing defiance, cessation of oblivion.

And she wondered.

How can she define nothingness,

when quantum mechanics tells us there is no such thing as an empty space?

# chronos


Eight, nine, ten, eleven

Staring at her watch, it’s past seven

Sixteen, seventeen, at the moment she’s eighteen

Yet chasing her life like she’s running on gasoline


She never wanted to die, or cease to exist

Questioning her purpose on a life she resists

When pain is a consequence of bare minimum

She longs for chronosynclastic infundibulum


She craves for the air, the noise, the blaring bass

For the rush, the unsafe, for the outer space

What she wants, given a chance, she knew would

Is to live a kairos life in this chronos world

# A Poem for Humanities
*(literally a school requirement)*


Back then four years ago, when I had a project

Parts of a newspaper I had to present

So I went out and found tons of that paper

To produce a compilation that I am the creator



While scanning through pages, I caught sight of a section

Loaded with pictures that had my attention

So after I finished the project I needed to pass

I made an album from the photos I had seen once



Later this week, for the subject Humanities

We're given an activity before we're dismissed

To show pictures of what they call 'work of art'

To be submitted the next meeting before we start



I stumbled through my books to look for something

But then it happened that I still have that 'thing'

Kept in a box, dusted and colored like a lime

I smiled as I scrolled to the pages going back in time



I decided to cut the photos once again

Smiling on the thought that it was four years hidden

But then, when I saw that it won’t be enough

I decided to search once again from that 'magic box'



I saw the art works of a person once special

Which I always kept as a sign of remembrance

I decided to pick one and add to the compilation

And I wrote this poem to give the explanation



And now I present to those who can see

The pictures that time had hidden to me

Showing, explaining the work of human arts

Summarized in five pages, divided into parts

# Cupcake and peas

*(i wrote this for an elementary paper pretending I was a first grade kid lol)*


I shared a cupcake with my seat mate

And she shared her bag of peas

At the shade of the tree, we sat

When someone, on our shoulders, pat.



"Give me your food!" The kid yelled

He took the cupcake from my friend

So i yelled "Teacher! Teacher! A bully!"

And came my teacher running in a hurry



Now he's talking to the principal

Probably teaching him some moral

So we sat back at the shade in peace

As we eat our cupcakes and peas

# Steven and numbers


My name is Steven, and I am seven

I don't like to go to school, to learn what's odd and even

But on the first day, I've met a new friend

And I realized now, I don't want the day to end.

She wears glasses when looking on our papers

She stands tall while teaching us numbers

She'd smile kindly at everyone in the room

And she makes sure no one feels gloom

The friend I met, we call her Teacher

She'd let us sing songs about one thing or another

She's kind and smart and we all love her

Now, i want to go back to school, cant wait for the night to be over

# what matters

And it lingers in your head a little longer than what’s necessary, a little harder than what’s it supposed to be.

You know. This day won’t matter in few years. You know.

Yet, you stare at your phone and think - does anything ever mattered, really?

# A Teacher, A Father

^36ba42



A child's first cry completes a father's smile.

The first footsteps. The first laughter.

But even though you weren't able to witness it,

As we take chapters in our book of life.

You were there. And you never leave.


Spring summer, as we create our own leaves,

You were there, pouring droplets of wisdom,

Watering us with thoughts that is nourishing us,

Making us the tree we want to be,

And what we supposed to be.


Autumn, winter, as each of us fall.

You were there, watching us, showing us that life isn't always fair.

Teaching us that what was meant to happen will always happen.

And as cold chilled us to the bones, as the winter frost covered our leaves,

Under the mistletoe, you were there. And you never leave.

Forever, love will always bind us.

No one can ever cut the thread connecting us.

Our splendid memories will always be remembered.

And as life erases time that passes by,

Always remember that a family will always remain family.

# broken


As I turned slowly, I saw your face

You walked towards me, I am amazed

I felt joy, the feeling that I missed

But pain creeps out, on my chest amidst.

I know it’s broken, nothing I can do

To fix it, mend it, but know I tried to

Like a piece of paper, trust was crumpled

Like a glass of water, poured and bubbled

I tried to smile but it seems so hard

Expecting return, but didnt had

You passed through me, like I’m a thin air

Like Im not there, it was so unfair.

Is it really broken? I asked myself

Was that the ending of the book in shelf?

I turned the pages, the last one’s gloomy

It’s hard to say, but it ended sadly

# paradox

I'm a little bit of this, but a little bit of that 

A little too much vain, a little too much not. 

I'm a little insecure, yet little too proud 

Little much this is me, little much was that.  

I'm too afraid, yet overly fearless 

I am talkative but usually speechless

I'm a little unfair, but too much just 

I fear the future, i fear the past  

I love the night when i hate the darkness

I love when it rains but i hate dampness

A little too clever but so much of a fool 

I'm too easy to read but a little too obscure  

I know too much but don't know a lot. 

I know i'm wrong, but then no, I'm not

I'll push you away, hoping you'll come back

I'm more than enough but there's so much i lack

I'll let you in only to shut you out

cause little bit of this, a little bit of that 

I'm a girl, every minute i'll change my mind 

A little of me is here, a little was hard to find.
