1) Always go out into public dressed and showered as if you were going to run into the love of your life.

2) Have only a few select friends to which you tell your deepest secrets to. It has to be someone you could never be sexually attracted to. Be there for him and he will do the same for you.

3) Never let anyone outside of your "circle" know what's going on. Always keep the appearance that everything in your life is going great. No one can respect a loser. So even if you are one, lie.

4. If drama occurs with some of your acquaintences, offer sound, yet neutral advice. Never waste energy in an argument that you're not really invested in. Plus it makes you appear like a good person if you're nice to both parties. You will remain friends with everyone.

5. ACTUALLY care about schoolwork. If your friends/romantic interest wants to hang out but you have an exam coming up, tell them you need to study. Earning an A on a hardass exam is a great fucking feeling. Friends change, your transcript doesn't.

6. Make friends with a few of your favorite professors. Visit them during their office hours, invite them to your apartment even. It may seem weird, but try to make them see you as a colleague rather than a student. References = Networking gold. You never know who they could hook you up with.

7. Always be mindful of your money situation, but always set aside some just to blow on worthless shit.

8. Join more clubs. You'd be surprised how many people share your interests. You can meet some really great people.

9. Find something to be passionate about (not obsessive, though). Other people (girls?) will share that passion too.

10. Read more. Read Plato, Dante's inferno, all the mainstream old and classics. It makes you look a lot smarter and you can use it to your advantage. Also read as many religious texts and science texts as possible. You never know when you could use these to appear more intelligent. Memorize a few quotes and you're set. It's really cool to see the parallels between the Koran and the Bible.

11. Memorize all of the countries and their capitals. Learn the states and their capitals too.

12. Watch more documentaries about a variety of subjects.

13. With all the stuff you know, never be an a**h*** about your intelligence. If someone asks "how do you know that" ask as if you "must have just picked it up somewhere". Never be the first to speak, always act. Let the other person think they are in control of whatever situation they are in. If you know what someone is saying is wrong, be very tentative about correcting them. "I dunno, I think maybe..." Always try to get people to underestimate you. The person who drums the loudest is usually hiding the most.

14. Try to appear aloof. If something actually bothers you, hide your emotions from others. Once again, only let your small circle of friends see the "real you."

15. Never make a promise you cannot keep to your circle of friends. To everyone else, be as strategically flakey as necessary. Make an excuse that lets them know you're really bummed out about skipping out.

16. Get a job while in college. Try to constantly be working, or constantly be learning. Apathy is death. Work out when you're tired of the former two. Don't let yourself go.

17. Pick a day of the week when you don't do much of anything. Read a book for fun, download a movie that isn't mainstream, read the news, draw even if you suck at it, play the guitar even if you suck at it, write down your thoughts on anything. Looking back on who you were is really interesting.
