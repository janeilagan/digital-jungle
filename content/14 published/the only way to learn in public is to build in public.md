This is to remind myself that I'm doing this for myself, for self-learning, and accept constructive feedback because those will push me into being a better version of myself. That it's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to change your mind, and it's okay to be embarrassed by what I originally put out, edit it again and make it better.
